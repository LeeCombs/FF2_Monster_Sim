TODO {
    Team "Arr Mateys" should get Z.Borgan added
    Status icons for buffs?
    Status icon for slow?
    Poison needs to damage each round
    Check if G Soul's cure is suppose to target the other team
    Monster team should walk off stage after the fight
}

Bugs {

    High:

        Scene B's back row is hittable?
        - Right side (reverseed) back row is left-most instead of right
        - Are scene b's rows actually flipped? Arr Matey looked wrong
        - Spell on all seems to happen in a weird order: 1a, 1b, 3a, 2b... When some are dead or always?

    Medium:

        A haste appeared to miss on a Flower enemy on the same team
        A self-killing enemy won't fade out and stop drawing (e.g. bomb blast)
}

Look into {
    Gaining a disabling status mid-round (paralysis) doesn't prevent a monster from taking its turn that round. 
    I'm pretty sure this is how it works regularly, but it needs confirmation.

    +---------------+

    For columns (a, b, c, d)
    Only front two columns (c,d) can be targetted by and use physical attacks
    If column d is removed, then (b,c), etc.
    It's the front-most active row, and the one behind it, even if it second one is empty

    Monsters do not make a special effort to be effective from back row
    If they choose to attack, they simply do "Nothing"
